                            Maharashtrian food first appear in India.

                            <mark>Maratha Empire (17th Century):</mark> The Maratha 
                            rule fostered a cuisine characterized by simplicity and flavor, 
                            visible in dishes like Puran Poli (sweetened lentil flatbread) 
                            and Aamti (spiced lentil curry). 
                            Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, 
                            vegetables, lentils and fruit are dietary staples.
                            Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. 
                            Meat was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well-off until recently, 
                            because of economic conditions and culture.
